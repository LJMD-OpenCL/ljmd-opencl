This program needs povray >=3.6 to generate snapshots of the trajectory files generated
by the ljmd-* programs.


=========================================

The program can be compiled by using 

$make

=========================================

The partial documentation of the program can be generated via
doxygen, with:

$make documents


==========================================



For creating videos from the images, one can use mencoder.

The program runs as follows:

$./ljmd-vis trajectoryname.xyz
$make video

The program reads the trajectory file frame by frame, and at every frame read it calls povray, and generates a snapshot (an image000...jpg file). Then, by executing "$make video", a call to mencoder will be made, which will create the file "output.avi"

Alternately to executing "make video", one can directly call mencoder, for instance:

mencoder mf://*.jpg -mf w=600:h=400:fps=6:type=jpg -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg4:mbd=2:trell -oac copy -o output.avi

will create the video with name "output.avi"
