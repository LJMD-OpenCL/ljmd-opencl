This program needs povray >=3.6 to generate snapshots of the trajectory files generated
by the ljmd-* programs.

For creating videos from the images, one can use mencoder.

The program runs as follows:

./ljmd-vis trajectoryname.xyz

The program reads the trajectory file frame by frame, and at every frame read it calls povray, and generates a snapshot (an image000...jpg file).

After al the trajectory file have been procesed, the set of images can be used to generate a video.
For instance, with mencoder:

mencoder mf://*.jpg -mf w=600:h=400:fps=6:type=jpg -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg4:mbd=2:trell -oac copy -o output.avi

will create the video with name "output.avi"

The command is stored in the script callmencoder.
