In this file will keep a TODO list of issues on which people can contribute:

- Code Documentation
- Makefile and compilation setting
- Code modularization (C/OpenCL/Utils/Input-Output)
- Code OpenCL engine to manage the technological mapping CPU/GPU
- Re-implement the hard coded thread launch
- Code instrumentation for performance analysis
- Other proposals to be discussed through the mailing list


=================================================================================

Current on-going production development:

Rodrigo:
1) Improve the data transfer performance (asynchronous compute / write output)
2) Improve the code's modularity

Oscar:
1) Project source management

Johannes:
1) Wrapping of the OpenCL arguments setting

Moses:
1) Internal code profiling

Ajasja:
1) on automatically chosing the right number of hardware threads
2) detecting platform to preferentially run on the GPU and then on the CPU
