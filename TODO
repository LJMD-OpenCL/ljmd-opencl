In this file will keep a TODO list of issues on which people can contribute:

- Code Documentation
- Makefile and compilation setting
- Code modularization (C/OpenCL/Utils/Input-Output)
- Code OpenCL engine to manage the technological mapping CPU/GPU
- Re-implement the hard coded thread launch
- Code instrumentation for performance analysis
- Other proposals to be discussed through the mailing list
